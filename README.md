# InterIIT-2023 Cybersecurity Contingent application (IIT Madras)

## Overview

This application consists of 3 challenges.

- `passcheck`
- `signer`
- `richboy`

None of these challenges are optional. Description for each of these challenges
is provided in a `README.md` located in the respective challenge's directory.

## How to submit

1. Clone this repository, and push it to your GitHub as a **private**
   repository. Make sure the repository stays private, else all of your work
   will be visible to everyone else.
2. Start working on the challenges and push your solutions to the private
   repository. You should document your solution in the `SOLUTIONS.md` provided
   for each of the challenges (this file has already been created for your
   convenience).
3. You can also add a top-level markdown file if you want to specify any other
   notes or cite references or for acknowledgements. This is completely
   optional.
4. Once you are done with your work, you can add me
   ([DMaroo](https://github.com/DMaroo)) as a collaborator for your private
   repository, so that I can evaluate your submission. After that, submit your
   details and repository link in [this Google
   form](https://forms.gle/ynD7sdjYqazUbqvbA).
   The form will close on _**5th November, 11:59 p.m**_. Do _NOT_ make your
   repository public at any point in time.
5. Good job! You're done. Now I'll be evaluating your submissions and getting
   back to you within a a few days.

## General advice

- Try to understand and figure things out by yourself. Use the internet
  extensively. Any questions about _"how"_ to solve any of the challenges would
  not be entertained.
- In the final submission, be _very **clear**_ about your approach, listing out
  all the steps you took. Submissions only having the final answers won't be
  rewarded.
- Any sort of plagiarism would lead to direct disqualification. You can,
  however, use the internet to learn about things and then solve the challenges.
- Read the challenge descriptions and guidelines (including this one) _very
  **carefully**_.

Happy hacking! ðŸš€
