# Code Documentation

This document explains the purpose and functionality of the provided code.

## Objective

The code demonstrates how to extract a cryptographic signature from an input string and then apply this signature to another modified string while preserving the original signature. This operation is performed with the use of the `Signer` class.

## Functionality

The code achieves the following:

1. Obtains a cryptographic signature for a byte string with 15 zeros and 1 one like (000...1).
2. Prepares a data string for signing, ensuring it is of a fixed length.
3. Creates a modified string with a pattern that will produce the same signature as another string.
4. Obtains a signature for the modified data by requesting for the signature of a partially encrypted string. 
    - The parially encrypted string obtained from the middle of the process of creating signature of the modified string.
    - it is obtained by XOR of the initially obtained cryptographic signature with the data string for signing.
    - pattern used for obtaining modified string is as follows - ('\0'*15 +'\1' + '\0'*16) + data_string
5. Applies the obtained signature to the modified string.
6. Verifies the applied signature to determine if it remains valid for the modified data.

The code showcases a scenario where the same signature can be applied to a modified version of the original data, assuming the modification follows specific patterns, such as XORing with a key.

## Summary

The code demonstrates a process of extracting a signature from one data set and then applying it to another data set, ensuring that the new data set generates the same signature.
